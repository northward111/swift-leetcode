# Summary

This repository is solely for leetcode practices. Every problem is solved in a separate file in /Sources/MyALgorithms directory, and the accompanying test file is in /Tests/MyAlgorithmsTests directory.

Update, since swift testing framework is recommended more, I changed the testing to Swift testing, which means newly added test cases are now in /Tests/MyAlgorithmsSwiftTesting directoty.

# To add one algorithm implementation
```
run the task named "Generate LeetCode Problem"
```

# Test cases not auto-detected?

This is a known issue with VSCode itself. Just reload window from the command palette and it would be fine.
